//! `sushi --version` report — the versions of the app and every embedded
//! engine, WITHOUT booting the HTTP server. The macOS app spawns
//! `sushi --version` as a one-shot subprocess and parses this so Settings
//! can show engine versions without a running server (Swift side:
//! `EngineVersions.parse`). Keep this a pure formatter — main.zig gathers the
//! runtime value (`mlx_version()`) and the build-time pins (`build_options`)
//! and calls `writeReport`.
