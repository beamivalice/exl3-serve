# Changelog

sushi began as a fork of [mlx-serve](https://github.com/ddalcu/mlx-serve) and was detached from it on 2026-09-17 at
mlx-serve commit `ef5e667` (two commits after mlx-serve v26.9.4). This file covers sushi's own changes since then;
earlier history is mlx-serve's, in that project's changelog.

## Unreleased

- **Chat in your browser**: `sushi serve` and `sushi run` serve a chat page at `http://127.0.0.1:12345/` that streams
  replies, shows the model's thinking, takes images for vision models and keeps your conversations in the browser.

## v1.0.3 — Hotfixes

- **Prompt cache**: re-packing a model in place no longer restores stale SSD cache entries, and the RAM cache stays
  within its cap when every entry is in use.
- **Video and labels**: multi-part videos that fit are no longer refused, and `/v1/models` names an EXL3 pack's
  expert rate beside its dense width.

---

## v1.0.2 — Hotfixes

- **Stability**: two cached conversations can no longer share a prompt-cache key, a failed long-context cache copy no
  longer frees memory twice, and very low temperatures behave the same with and without MTP.
- **Memory and loading**: two resident models no longer over-commit memory at admission, and packs with invalid EXL3
  rate stamps are refused by name.

---

## v1.0.1 — Hotfixes

- **Tool calls and streaming**: streamed tool calls are always valid JSON, the reasoning budget applies to tool replies
  and Anthropic streams, and a disconnected Responses request is no longer stored as completed.
- **Prefix cache and loading**: fixes for SSD cache restores and failed cache writes, and malformed pack configs are
  refused by name.

## v1.0.0 — Qwen3.8-Flash-Next, sushi-packed

![Sushi-3bpw decode and prefill from 4k to 1M tokens on an M5 Max](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/beamivalice/sushi/main/docs/assets/perf-sushi3bpw-1m.png)

- **Two Qwen3.8-Flash-Next packs, EXL3 experts**: Sushi-3bpw (49.3 GiB, for 64 GB Macs) and Sushi-4bpw (63.7 GiB, for
  96 GB and up). At about 50 GiB, Sushi-3bpw has half the KLD of mlx-serve's iQ-MLX 3.3bpw; Sushi-4bpw matches oMLX
  oQ5e's quality in 20 GiB less memory.
- **Up to 1M tokens of context on one Mac**: 94 tok/s decode and about 1,900 tok/s prefill on an M5 Max, still 57 tok/s
  at 1M, with the 8-bit KV cache and the model's own MTP draft head on by default. `--mtp-typical 0.2` makes sampled
  decoding 15-20% faster.
- **Images in every API**: OpenAI chat and Responses, Anthropic messages and tool results all carry images to the
  vision tower, each where it was sent, and a large image needs about half the memory it did.
- **A drop-in local server**: OpenAI- and Anthropic-compatible HTTP on `127.0.0.1:12345`, clear of mlx-serve's 11234.
  `sushi run` chats in the terminal with read-only web and file tools, `sushi launch` sets up Claude Code, pi, omp,
  opencode and codex, and one thinking-effort vocabulary (off to max) works across every API.
- **Memory you can plan**: a load that would not fit is refused by name, concurrent long prompts wait instead of
  crashing, an unload answers once its memory is free, and `/v1/models` reports the real resident size.
- **Install with curl**: one ad-hoc signed binary for Apple Silicon on macOS 26.2 or later, with no Python at serve time.
