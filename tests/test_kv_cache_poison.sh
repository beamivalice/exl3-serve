# Test: KV cache poisoning after pad-only generation
#
# Bug: When the model generates only <pad> tokens (e.g., due to a confusing prompt),
# the KV cache retains the corrupted state. ALL subsequent requests then also
# produce <pad> tokens, even requests that would normally succeed on a fresh server.
#
# Reproduction:
#   1. Fresh server → request A succeeds (e.g., 14+ tokens)
#   2. Send request B that causes pad-only output (e.g., long noisy tool result)
#   3. Re-send request A → FAILS with pad-only output (cache poisoned)
#
# Expected: Request A should always succeed, regardless of prior requests.
