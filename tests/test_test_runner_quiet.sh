# test_test_runner_quiet.sh — a passing test prints NOTHING, on either stream.
#
# CLAUDE.md already bans stdout from a test: under `zig build test` fd 1 is the
# build runner's protocol pipe and one stray byte hangs the runner forever.
# stderr is not free either. The pinned Zig nightly reports ANY stderr a test
# step produced through its failure renderer, so a suite that passed 69/69
# prints
#
#     test
#     +- run test w
#     <the test's own output>
#     failed command: .../test --cache-dir=./.zig-cache --seed=0x... --listen=-
#
# and no Build Summary, while exiting 0. That is indistinguishable from a real
# failure at a glance and has been read as one. So: benchmark and diagnostic
# lines in a test ride an env switch (SUSHI_EXL3_LAYER_UBENCH for the EXL3
# ones); only a test that is about to FAIL may print.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_test_runner_quiet.sh [test-filter]   (default: the whole suite)
