# test_gpu_lock.sh — the one-heavy-GPU-job lock (scripts/gpu-lock.sh).
#
# Checks, on a private lock dir:
#   1. status reports "free" when nobody holds it
#   2. acquire takes it and status names the owner
#   3. a second acquire waits while the lock is held
#   4. release by another owner (queued or not) is refused and keeps the lock
#   5. release by the holder frees it, and the waiter then gets it
#   6. waiters are served first-come-first-served, even when a later one polls faster
#   7. a waiter that died leaves the queue: status drops it and the next waiter is served
#   8. status lists the holder, then the queue in ticket order
#   9. break (coordinator only, for a dead holder) frees the lock only when it names the holder
#
# No GPU, no model, seconds.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_gpu_lock.sh
