#!/bin/bash
# test_serving_deps.sh — the served binary's runtime dependency and refusal contract.
#
# This engine serves mimo_v2 / qwen4_exp / EXL3 on our self-built MLX, and
# nothing else. A stray `linkSystemLibrary(...)` re-links silently and can make
# the binary unlaunchable without a staged dylib no served path ever calls.
#
# Checks:
#   1. zig-out/bin/sushi exists (build it first)
#   2. otool -L lists no non-system dylib beyond the staged MLX and libwebp
#   3. the staged MLX is still linked (the contract is "no stray deps", not "no deps")
#   4. an unknown flag is REJECTED BY NAME, never silently eaten — a script that
#      passes one must fail loudly, not serve under different settings (the
#      flag-eater rule, docs/server-lifecycle.md)
#   5. a checkpoint in an unsupported file format is refused by name before load
#
# No model, no server, seconds.
#
# Usage: ./tests/test_serving_deps.sh
